A school for the deaf and hard of hearing, Gallaudet University’s average sexual assault rate was 12.6 cases per 1,000 students between 2014 and 2021. 

Located in Washington D.C., Gallaudet University had nearly eight times as many instances of rape each year than the four largest neighboring colleges, according to the U.S. Department of Education’s Campus Safety and Security statistics. George Washington University, Georgetown University, American University, and Howard University each reported less than two cases per year. George Washington University had the second highest rate of rape in the city with 1.88 instances for every thousand students.

Since Gallaudet has such a small population of roughly a thousand students, these rates of sexual assault may be inflated compared to larger schools. However, when they are compared to colleges of similar size, it is clear that Gallaudet still leads the pack in the number of instances of rape per student. Claremont McKenna College has nearly the same number of students, yet their yearly rate of sexual assault per student is almost 2.5 times lower than Gallaudet’s.

While Gallaudet University is the predominant institution for students who are deaf or hard of hearing in the United States, there are a few other universities that have specialized programs for students with disabilities. However, these schools also have a much lower rate of rape than Gallaudet. For example, the Rochester Institute of Technology had 0.61 cases per 1,000 students yearly and the University of California had 0.66. 

Founded in 1864, Gallaudet University has served people who are deaf or hard of hearing for over 150 years. With a total enrollment of just over a thousand students, the university is committed to supplying individuals with “the knowledge and practical skills vital to achieving personal and professional success,” as stated in their vision statement. 

Gallaudet excels in visual learning and bilingual education in order to prepare students for the competitive world. The university prides itself on providing students with the resources they need in order to succeed.

However, even at a school specifically designed to accommodate individuals with disabilities, deaf students are still at a much higher risk of experiencing sexual assault. In 2015, Al Jazeera conducted a six month investigation into sexual violence at Gallaudet and found that the school has done little to implement adequate resources for victims of sexual assault. This criticism, though, is the explanation former dean of student affairs Dwight Benedict gave in response to this investigation. He claimed that the real reason Gallaudet’s rate of sexual assault is so much more than other schools is because they have a more advanced system of reporting. 

Gallaudet officials declined to respond to questions from this reporter.

One reason students may struggle with reporting is confusion about what certain resources can provide for victims. Many schools have Title IX offices that deal with investigations of sexual assault, but these groups are not meant for student advocacy. 

Fariha Quasem, the director for equity and deputy Title IX coordinator at American University, notes that this misunderstanding can inhibit students’ ability to find the right sources of support. To highlight Title IX’s actual role, she says, “our office is a compliance office - we have to comply with the law.” 

However, this does not mean that student advocacy resources don’t exist on campuses. Michelle Dagne is a victim services advocate at American’s well being and psychological center. She emphasizes the importance of seeking support to process instances of sexual assault. Her main piece of advice is to find somebody to talk to. Dagne says, “reach out to a friend or a neighbor or a hotline, anybody so you’re not going through it alone.”

While Gallaudet has an elevated rate of rape compared to other schools, deaf college students across the nation consistently experience instances of sexual assault more often than those without disabilities. In a 2015 study by the National Institute of Health, nearly 70% of deaf undergraduate women reported being raped compared to an estimated 13% of all students (RAINN). 

College students are consistently more likely to experience sexual assault than other age groups. However, the elevated risk of rape among deaf people is not limited to those in school and extends to people of all ages. Research has revealed that people with disabilities are exponentially more likely to experience rape than those without disabilities.

In a study by the National Survey of Family Growth from 2011 to 2017, 25% of women with a sensory disability said they had been raped versus 15% of women without a disability. Another study found that nearly twice as many women with a disability reported having experienced sexual assault than women without a disability, according to the 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey. 

This research over the past decade has consistently shown that disabled people are sexually assaulted more often than people without disabilities, but there hasn’t been any effective action to reduce the rate of rape among these communities. 

Disabled people are at a disadvantage when it comes to finding sufficient resources for victims of sexual assault. This is because the stigma around disability hinders the ability to have conversations about discrimination, which leads to a lack of funding and research for these groups. 

American University professor Tanja Aho specializes in disability and gender studies. They explain how this stigma needs to be broken down in order to provide support for people with disabilities. 

“We are taught to think in many ways that being disabled is a bad thing, a thing to be avoided, a thing to mourn when it happens,” says Aho. “If we listened and learned more from disabled people we would know that this is not true.”

To better understand how to support disabled communities, their voices need to be amplified in social and political forums. Without adequate representation in these spheres, it is impossible to implement successful methods of countering the prevalence of sexual assault among people with disabilities.
