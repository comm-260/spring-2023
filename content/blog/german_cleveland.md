Despite German immigrants being on the heftier end of Cleveland, Ohio's population from the early 1800's and onward, there ar very few representations of so many Clevelanders' heritage from Deutschland, as well as the decrease in German inhabitants of the city in recent years.

### How do the numbers of German descendants in Cleveland today compare to that of the early settlement of the city?

- From 1870, there was a .9% decrease from the German population in Cleveland as recent as 2020.

### But Why the Decrease?

Was there a decrease in interest of Cleveland that ultimately drove out its immigrant population? Or was it something deeper?

It's important to look at the _why_ in this case.
- Why did Germans migrate to Celveland in the First place?

It is said that German immigrants were escaping political oppression, religious persecution, and economic depression when they migrated to Cleveland, Ohio after the opening of the Ohio Canal, which made the city more accessible to get to, and later with the production of railroads.

Many Germans moved to Cleveland from Pennsylvania along Zane's Trace (a trail based on Native American walking paths in the 1790's).

A lot of German immigrants came in hopes to fullfill a job in construction, in which they would assist in the construction of the Ohio Canal, which would later aid more German and other European immigrants to come to Cleveland. Many German construction workers also built some of the first railways to cross the state of Ohio in the 1840's.

Other German's left their homeland in search of farmlands, so they migrated to Ohio with the promise to grow bountiful crops to sustain their families needs.

### Skills and Craftsmanship
German immigrants, much like every other immigrant group to settle in the United States, provided their new country with a plethora of skills, like that of jewelry making, tailoring, and cabinet making.

### The Arts
Arts emerged and buildings in the city were designed by German American architects, further cementing their fingerprint on the creation of the city we know as Cleveland today.

### Immigrants and American Ignorance
But, in true American fashion, there was an ignorance that sparked in Cleveland against its immigrant population.

Native Ohioans and Clevelanders did not trust their new neighbors from Germany and accused them of stealing jobs from native United States citizens. Sounds familiar, does it not?

As a result of this distates and distrust for Germans and their immigrant counterparts, they began forming their own communities to provide their families with a safer neighborhood away from the disapporiving citizens of Cleveland.

### Verschwindende Deutsche - The Disappearing Germans
Because of assimilation following the Second World War, a large portion of German immigrant influences on Cleveland as well as the number of migrants to the city have essentially dissapated from the area.

However, this is not to say that Germans are the only cultural group to experience a down tick in their population numbers in Cleveland.

For instance, the Irish immigrant population was no longer a part of the top ten immigrant population groups in Cleveland by 1930, with a .3% decrease in their numbers.

It's easy to assume that the decrease in immigration to Cleveland can be do to the current climate of the world, there is no World War II or the like going on currently, and Cleveland is not as economically tatalizing as it once was.

Of course, the real reason for this decline is hard to identify. But one thing remains: the immigrant culture runs through the veins of the city to this day. Little Italy is a prominent fixture in Downtown Cleveland, there are plenty of authentic Hungarian and Polish cuisine spots, and Irish dancing is a popular childhood activity many young Clevelanders experienced growing up. But German culture is confined to the west side of the city, in the West Side Market, and in the beer gardens and halls like Hofbr≈†uhaus. German architects influence remains as well in the foundations of the city, many of the buildings that stand there today were designed or constucted by the German immigrant population of the past.
