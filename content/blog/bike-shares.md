The Covid-19 outbreak in 2020 led to business shutting down, and people being socially isolated in their homes. This affected Bike Sharing services, as people were not leaving their homes as often. Capital Bikeshare, the official bikeshare programs for D.C.,  is steadily recovering from the fall in usage in 2020, following the Covid-19 outbreak. 

## Micro-mobility

In 2022 the usage more than doubled from 2020, according to the data released by Capital Bikeshare. "Capital Bikeshare trips declined by about 40% in 2020 due to the pandemic," said German Vigil, Public information officer at the District Department of Transportation. "Since then, ridership has fully recovered, and in 2022 the number of trips was higher than 2019."

A sharp increase in the rides was observed from 2020 to 2022. The number of rides picked up once the regulations around social isolation started loosening up. Capital bikes have increased micro mobility in D.C. during 2021 around forty percent of car trips were replaced by micro mobility, according to the report by North American Bike Share Association.
 
## Memberships for College Students

Capital Bikeshare has introduced membership plans for frequent users to be cost efficient; they have hourly plans and annual plans. "Capital Bikeshare has membership plans for students and partnerships with all major universities within the District," said Vigil. The University membership program is only available for annual memberships, as DDOT explains that it is the "most cost effective membership type."

From 2020 to 2022, Capital Bikeshare observed one fourth increase in its memberships, which correlates with the increase in usage of Capital Bikeshare over the three years. In 2022, Capital bikeshare experienced about sixty percent increase in rides from 2020.

Despite the Covid outbreak 2020 registered 2,216,914 rides with August being the month with the most rides. During August, the degree of social isolation was less due to a summer with less cases in D.C, which might have increased the use of CaBi.

In 2021, the total number of rides increased to 2,749,881, which was about a quarter increase from 2020. In 2021 the month with the most rides was October, which is understandable as universities in D.C. went back to in person classes in the Fall semester. A majority of bikeshare users are between the ages of 25 to 44, as reported by NABSA.

Universities opening and the inflow of students into D.C.is a likely reason for the spike in the usage of Capital Bikeshare as a majority of Capital Bikeshare users are College students, who use CaBi to commute to university or around D.C. "They are definitely convenient," said Eman Sultan, a Student at an American university. "I think I have seen at least three bike stations around AU." Sultan, like many other college students, uses CaBi to commute to her University.

In 2022, there were 3,476,782 recorded rides, with the most used month being July. This is a bit unexpected as Universities are either having summer classes, with less students on campus, or summer break. So July being the month with the most rides is unexpected.

There is an obvious difference between the usage of CaBi over the three years.The usage increased gradually in 2021 but at the start of 2022 there was a rapid increase which started to decrease towards the end of the year, according to the data from Capital Bikeshare. The usage goes in cyclical periods; the usage increases at the start of the year, reaching an all time high around August to October, and then starts to decline towards the end of the year.

There was a sharp decrease in CaBi usage in April 2020. D.C. registered its first Covid case in mid-March, 2020. The weeks following it were filled with misinformation and uncertainty among the general public, which may have caused the rapid decline in usage of CaBi. Enforced social isolation is possibly a big factor why ridership dropped in 2020.

## Types of Bikes

CaBis' fleet consists of three different bike types; classic, docked and electric bikes. The classic and electric type of bikes were introduced later in 2020. The most preferred bike in 2020 was the docked bike, the data for which can be deceiving as the other two types of bikes were not available for the majority of 2020. In 2021 and 2022, classic bikes were the most popular ones, despite electric bikes being more convenient.

CaBi has more classic bikes in its fleet compared to the number of electric bikes, which is why there were fewer rides for electric bikes, clarifies Vigil. "We do see that ebikes are used almost twice as frequently as classic bikes, so as we obtain and deploy more ebikes, we expect to see the ebike trip numbers increase,' Vigil said. "DDOT plans on having 2,500 e-bikes deployed by the end of 2024, a significant increase from the 1,000 we have now."

CaBi released a new upgraded version of their electric bikes on 20th March, 2023. The newer models are a bit heavier than the older models but they have a larger battery and a 60-mile range. "I have ridden the older ebike from CaBi, they are fun to use," said Jelina Solomon, as Student at American university. "They are hard to come by, I think I've only used them a few times this semester.'

A majority of Capital Bikeshare users took Jefferson Dr & 14th St SW the most over the last three years, which is along the national mall. The trend of riding bikes across the National Mall has been picking up, Capital Bikeshare has 5 bikeshare stations spread across it. 

DDOT permits four main e-scooter companies; Lime, Lyft, Spin and Veo to operate shared fleet devices in public spaces in D.C. With the popularity of electric scooters, CaBi has plans to expand into that market in the future. "We are interested in exploring that idea and are watching the pilot of docked e-scooters in Chicago's Divvy system closely," said Vigil.
