“As embarrassing as it is, I don't know what he’s watching past video games.” said Christina Stino, a mother of two. Stino says her son spends most of his free time outside of school and extracurricular activities watching online gaming content. Stino, a single mother and owner of a hairdressing salon says she does not have the time she would like to monitor her childrens content consumption. “I got a charge on my credit card for Twitch and he said it was like Netflix.” Stino said.

Stino’s experience is not uncommon, according to a 2022 [study](https://www.dailysabah.com/life/health/youth-spend-triple-amount-of-time-online-than-watching-tv-research) released by The Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK) children between the ages of 15-21 spend an average of four hours and 37 minutes daily consuming online content. Out of an average of 2.58 million concurrent viewers on popular streaming service Twitch, an [estimated](https://backlinko.com/twitch-users) 41% is between the ages of 16-21. 

Twitch, an online platform for live-streaming, has seen rapid growth over the past several years. The platform was [purchased](https://www.emeoutlookmag.com/industry-insights/article/91-amazon-buys-twitch-for-970-million-cash#:~:text=Amazon.com%20Inc%20snapped%20up,beyond%20its%20core%20retail%20operations.) in 2014 in an $970 million deal made by Amazon. Since then there has been substantial growth in total watchtime from 2017 to 2022. Further bolstering a massive uptick following the COVID-19 shutdowns in march of 2020, which at year's end reflected a nearly 52% increase in total viewership over 2019. Reflective of more viewers home from school, work, and daily activities.

Tyler Kwak, a part time twitch-streamer of  “Super Mario 64” and street violinist says he saw his viewership rise significantly during COVID. “At the time performing was helping me during college. So when I lost that, I had more time to focus on my runs [gaming speed running.]” Kwak continued, “I just had more time to put content out, and people had more time to watch. It was a win-win I guess and it helped make up for the money I was losing when no one was out.”

Kwak says that as a small streamer, his income relies primarily on donations from audience members rather than sponsorships. “I just do small things. Shout them out during chat, and it lets their comment be read to me outloud on the stream. So it’s kind of a fun interactive experience.” Kwak said. 

Top twitch streamers rely on a variety of sources for income – and make substantial amounts of it. Sources include advertising revenue, sponsorships, donations, and subscriptions to the creator. The cost of a single [subscription](https://brave.com/learn/how-much-money-do-twitch-streamers-earn/#:~:text=The%20cost%20of%20a%20Twitch,%2412.50%20per%20subscription%20per%20month.)  can range from $2.50 to $12.50 per month. Twitch partners earn a minimum of 50% of advertising revenue the platform brings. While small numbers, multiplied by thousands with larger streamers can provide for remarkable earnings.

Out of the top 2000 streamers, only 11.5% identify their content as “mature” content which triggers a prompt when opening a stream and while viewing. Despite this, streamers that operate within general Twitch guidelines have free reign over their content with little regulation even if they do not identify their content as mature. Hate-speech, nudity, and copyright are all heavily enforced on the platform for any age group but mature language, violent content, or self-destructive behavior are commonplace. Despite the company's terms-of-service which claims to take action in an excessive amount of such.

Twitch currently has no option for specific parental controls. With each channel having an option for live chat where viewers can interact with the streamer and fellow viewers. Moderators and the streamer themselves can restrict certain words or phrases in the chat but there is no universal ban on language. 

While the games themselves may contain age-appropriate content, it does not necessarily entail the streamer themselves as well.

Fortnite, which was the 8th most streamed game over the past six months, and third most streamed over the past 4 years and has a [player base](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/fortnite-statistics/) which is 60.4% between the ages of 16-24. It is however estimated that at least half of that percentage lied about their age in order to gain access. Fortnite has created an extensive marketing campaign of childrens toys and merchandise, along with in-game purchases of character emotes and special character costumes. The same can be said for Minecraft – which is a game for all ages but has an extensive foothold in the child/young adult market place. 

Dylan Petrov, a twitch streamer who primarily streams games like fortnite says he doesn’t worry about assumptions about the audience of a game while streaming, “It’s a game for people of any age really.” Petrov continued, “I don’t limit my content because kids may be watching.”

Petrov says he does use mature language and openly discusses his life as a 25 year old, he doesn’t try to market his audience towards kids,  “I think it’s only a problem when people pretend like it’s kids content and then just manipulate their obviously young audience.” Petrov said.

Unless Twitch provides increased parental control on their platform and cracks down on content creators – it is likely that children will continue to have easy access to unmonitored content. Like generations of the past, parents have grown increasingly concerned with how new technology and platforms are influencing the behavior and opinions of their children. With notable growth in both average viewership and money to be made in the field, it is unlikely services like Twitch will be slowing down anytime soon.

Parents must begin to adapt to a less straightforward and unregulated form of content consumption. Although popular games might seem harmless, the commentary over them is likely influencing children and is evidently increasingly popular in schools and for young adults. The generational gap in how adults and young adults consume content has created a clear problem for the understanding of what is being watched, and how.
