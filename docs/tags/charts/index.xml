      <description>The NCAA March Madness basketball tournament is a place where anything can and will happen. What draws people in every year, however, are the underdogs, the Cinderella stories and the upsets.
The difference in talent between underdogs and higher seeded teams is enough to make most tournament upsets seem improbable, which is why fans love the March Madness tournament so much. It is a place where the improbable becomes reality. The NCAA website defines an upset as a lower seeded team beating a team at least two seeds above them.</description>

      <description>At American University in D.C., the men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s basketball season recently came to an end. Both ended up 7th in the league and made it to the Patriot League Championship. Yet the packed stands for the men&amp;rsquo;s games was a stark contrast to the fans that straggled in for the women.
The difference in attendance was reflected in the ticket prices. Demand was high enough for men that the box office could afford to set the tickets to 40$, while the women&amp;rsquo;s tickets stayed a constant 8$ a piece.</description>

Toombs grew up on the South Shore almost her entire life, moving from a small condo near the lakeshore to a house.</description>

      <description>In the 1930s and 1940s cigarette companies would advertise themselves as doctor-recommended. One R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company advertisement read “More doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette.” In 1978 a law was passed that authorized school districts to equip high schools with designated smoking areas. After years of not only normalizing but encouraging tobacco use, Lung cancer is now the second most common cancer among both men and women trailing behind prostate cancer for men and breast cancer for women.</description>

      <description>When 21-year-old Chinese international student Shangman Zhao came to the United States to study, she found it difficult to strike a balance between her academic pursuits and maintaining a healthy diet. As a result, she started consuming more fast food, which led to weight gain.
&amp;ldquo;When I see the number on the scale, I really feel distressed,&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot; Zhao said.
Zhao&amp;rsquo;s experience is not uncommon, as global obesity rates have nearly doubled since 1975, with over 1 billion people worldwide classified as obese, including 650 million adults, 340 million adolescents, and 39 million children, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) .</description>
