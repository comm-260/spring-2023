    <p>Mass shootings are an American phenomenon. In 2023, the United States is setting a record pace for mass killings, with these horrific incidents happening roughly once a week.</p>
<p>Per the Gun Violence Archive, mass shootings are defined as incidents in which four or more victims are shot or killed, excluding the perpetrator, at the same location at roughly the same time. 208 mass shootings have happened in the U.S. this year with 21 alone in May. There have been 129 days in 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Number of Mass Shootings Between January and May 9</strong></p>
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13699197"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
<p>From the shooting at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/nashville-school-shooting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nashville elementary school</a>
 in March, leaving six children and six adults dead to the attack at a <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/article271490312.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles Dance Studio</a>
 in January, leaving 12 dead. Just last week six people, five teenagers, were shot and killed by a convicted rapist on trial on child pornography charges in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/7-people-found-dead-oklahoma-shot-head-apparent-murder-suicide-authori-rcna82773" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oklahoma</a>
. And over the weekend, a man opened fire at an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/texas-mall-shooting-allen.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allen, Texas mall</a>
, killing 9 people, including a 3-year-old boy and his parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody should be shocked,&rdquo;&quot; said Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter Jaime was one of 17 people killed at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida in 2018. &ldquo;I visit my daughter in a cemetery. Outrage doesn&rsquo;t begin to describe how I feel.&rdquo;&quot;</p>
<p>According to a database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today, the Parkland victims are among the more than 2,800 people who fell victim to mass killings in the U.S. since 2006. This represents just a fraction of the deadly violence that happens in the U.S. annually.</p>
<p>The motive behind these killings is for several reasons. Murder-suicides and domestic violence, gang retaliation, school shootings, and workplace vendettas. According to a dataset from Mother Jones highlighting mass shootings in the U.S. since 1982, 37% of the shootings happened in the workplace and 15% were school shootings.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13698862"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
<p>Incidents like the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/15/briefing/mass-shooting-buffalo-new-york.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buffalo, New York supermarket shooting</a>
 in May 2022, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/24/us/texas-shooting-newtown.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uvalde, Texas school shooting</a>
 that happened just ten days after Buffalo, and even the <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/10/02/active-shooter-situation-breaks-out-near-las-vegas-casino-cops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 Las Vegas music festival shooting</a>
, the deadliest mass shooting in American history, continue to send cities around the country into mourning. Repeated calls for gun reform have been made, but Congress has yet to make any progress.</p>
<p>According to a Gallup News Poll, 57% of Americans are wanting stricter gun laws. 32% of Americans believe the gun laws should stay as is, and 10% say the laws should be less strict. This issue falls largely on party lines.</p>
<p>Per another Gallup News Poll, 91% of Democrats are wanting stricter laws, while only 24% of Republicans agree.</p>
<p>Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court set new standards for reviewing the nation&rsquo;s gun laws, calling into question firearm restrictions across the country. 9 states have put a ban on assault weapons: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. The District of Columbia has also put in place an assault weapon ban within its borders.</p>
<p><strong>States with Assault Weapon Bans Ð 2023</strong></p>
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/13545669"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
<p>The Second Amendment Foundation is an organization based out of Bullevue, Washington that is dedicated to promoting a better understanding about privately owning and possessing firearms. The members of this organization all associate themselves with the Republican Party.</p>
<p>In Cook County, Illinois, there&rsquo;s a semi-automatic firearm ban in place. Attorneys representing the Second Amendment Foundation and its partners are challenging this Illinois county&rsquo;s semi-automatic firearm ban.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cook County has made only one argument in its motion that seems to misread the Supreme Court&rsquo;s Bruen ruling from June of last year,&rdquo;&quot; said Second Amendment Foundation founder and Executive Vice President Alan M. Gottlieb.</p>
<p>One June 23, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a 6-3 decision in the New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen that expanded the right of Americans to bear arms as guaranteed by the Second Amendment of the Constitution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every firearm can be used for self-defense, and either the county knows that already, or they are woefully ignorant about firearms in general, and especially the ones affected by the ban,&rdquo;&quot; Gottlieb added.</p>
<p>Those that are pro-gun rights are very adamant on their beliefs. Second Amendment Foundation Director Adam Kraut noted that &ldquo;the Bruen ruling made it clear that every Second Amendment case must proceed first by analyzing the text of the amendment and then examining the country&rsquo;s history of firearm regulation, to determine whether the banned firearm is Ôdangerous and unusual.&rsquo; One look at the number of modern semiautomatic rifles currently owned by private citizens shows they are hardly Ôdangerous and unusual&rsquo; in any context.&rdquo;&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The county is simply wrong in its arguments, and the motion for summary judgment should be denied,&rdquo;&quot; Kraut continued.</p>
<p>The National Rifle Association (NRA) is the most powerful gun lobby in the United States. They have a substantial budget to influence members of Congress on gun policy. Over the last few Congressional election cycles, the NRA and other organizations have consistently spent more on pro-gun rights messaging than their rivals in the gun control lobby. The NRA did not respond to my request for comment.</p>
<p><strong>Gun Rights Groups Spending Compared to Gun Control Groups</strong></p>
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13545752"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
<p>On the flipside, Moms Demand Action is a movement and organization of Americans fighting for public safety measures that can protect people from gun violence. Shannon Watts is a mother of five who founded this organization. The day after the tragic Sandy Hook shooting, Watts started a Facebook group promoting gun safety and ways to reduce gun violence. Over a decade later, the group has almost 10 million supporters.</p>
<p>Moms Demand Action is in partnership with Everytown Gun Safety, the largest gun violence prevention organization in the country.</p>
<p>It is the government&rsquo;s job to serve the people and give them what they want. But if 57% of Americans are wanting stricter gun laws, and Congress just continues to give thoughts and prayers every time an incident happens, are they really doing their job? It&rsquo;s time for these government officials to wake up and realize that this problem will not go away until some sort of action is taken.</p>
<p>Jamie Guttenberg would be 19 years old today. Now her father spends his days as a gun control activist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Americans shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised by where we are today, it&rsquo;s all in the numbers. The numbers don&rsquo;t lie. But we need to do something immediately to fix it,&rdquo;&quot; Guttenberg said.</p>
