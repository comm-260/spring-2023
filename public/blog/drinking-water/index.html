      <strong>By Bella Barbosa</strong>
      
        
      
    </h5>
    

    

    <p>Many often assume that unsafe drinking water is an issue of the past, only felt today by countries in the global south. It’s easy to assume that safe drinking water is accessible in the United States, one of the wealthiest countries in the world.</p>
<p>Except, it’s not that simple for a quarter of Americans who do not have access to clean drinking water. For almost 90 million U.S. residents, this is an everyday problem. While many Americans are familiar with certain water crises, such as in Flint, Michigan, or Jackson, Mississippi, most are unaware of the scope of contaminated drinking water in the U.S.</p>
<p>Contaminated drinking water is an issue that is easy to downplay as those most affected tend to live in communities with predominantly marginalized groups. Of the locations impacted by contaminated water, a significant portion have communities living below the poverty line with large populations of racial minorities.</p>
<iframe title="Count of Drinking Water Violations by County" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-iHYlp" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iHYlp/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="457" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>
<p>For Texas’ Harris County, the county with the most drinking water violations in the U.S. in 2020, 20.3% of the population is Black, and 44.4% is Hispanic or Latino. 16.4% of the population is living below the poverty line in Harris County. While these numbers may not seem too striking, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of EPA data.</p>
<p>According to Kevin Rolland, an EPA employee working in the Office of Water Data Analysis Branch, the EPA is currently facing this difficulty. The locations with drinking water violations that states report to the EPA are sometimes too broad to really understand who is being disproportionately impacted by contaminated drinking water, Roland explains.</p>
<p>“We can take our best guess based on the information we have, but we want somebody to ground truth that to make sure that the violation is, in fact, touching the demographics of the area” we care about,” he said.</p>
<h2 id="a-history-of-environmental-injustice">A History of Environmental Injustice</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/watered-down-justice-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watered Down Justice</a>
, a report looking at the issue of environmental justice in drinking water access, found similar results when analyzing EPA data from 2016-2019, indicating that this has been a longstanding problem.</p>
<p>Almost a decade ago, the Flint water crisis enlightened the public about the U.S.’s contaminated drinking water problem.</p>
<p>Dr. Kristi Pullen Fedinick, Executive Director of the Center for Earth, Energy and Democracy and coauthor of Watered Down Justice, attributes much of the water contamination problem to aging infrastructure that leads to contaminants leaking into water systems.</p>
<p>Interest in environmental justice in relation to drinking water peaked during the Flint water crisis back in 2014. Gina Luster, a Flint resident, and co-founder of Flint Rising, a water advocacy group, fought on the front lines of the crisis almost a decade ago.</p>
<p>Luster first noticed changes in her hair and skin texture before things escalated to achy bones and behavioral changes. It was not long after seeing a decline in her and her family’s health that Luster saw the water in her home turn army green.</p>
<p>This past February, Flint was finally taken off of a boil water advisory due to water samples testing safe to drink. However, for Luster and many in Flint, a lack of trust in the government and Flint’s water system has prevented them from drinking water from the tap.</p>
<p>For Luster, the aging infrastructure is the problem, and until it’s updated, this problem will not be resolved.</p>
<p>“The water could come from God, from the Heavens. As soon as it touches our infrastructure, it’s poison,” she said.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-these-contaminants-impact-us">How do these contaminants impact us?</h2>
<p>The most common contamination found is microbial contamination. Ingesting microbial contaminants most commonly leads to acute microbial and gastrointestinal illnesses, though other contaminants can have more severe impacts, such as chronic chemical illnesses like bladder cancer.</p>
<p>In the case of Toledo, Ohio, the city water system had to be shut down for a week because of cyanotoxins that came from the algae in Lake Eerie. Richard Weisman, an Environmental Engineer in the EPA Office of Drinking Water Standards and Risk Management Division, says algae is an increasingly big concern as more algae are growing as a result of climate change.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-the-solution">So, what’s the solution?</h2>
<p>Contaminants get into our water in one of two ways. Either through the source water – rivers and lakes or the soil surrounding groundwater, or through pipe breaks in the distribution system. Aging infrastructure is a big threat to our drinking water. When a pipe breaks, many people are impacted by boil water advisories or, in extreme cases, the entire water system is shut down for a period of time.</p>
<p>In order to address aging infrastructure the EPA estimates about half a trillion dollars is necessary. Though outside organizations have estimated as much as a trillion dollars in order to update water distribution infrastructure.</p>
<p>But where will this money come from? And what does it mean for low-income communities who are already being left behind in the quest for safe drinking water?</p>
<p>There are three different systems of operation for the 50,000 community water systems in the United States. Water systems are either run as a branch of local government with the city in charge, a private company that has been contracted out by the city, or a quasi-public entity that the city has appointed to run the utility independently.</p>
<p>In all three instances, each individual utility is responsible for replacing infrastructure as needed. Water utilities have the option to either get this funding through charging a water bill, grants, or loans.</p>
<p>While federal legislation such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has aimed to address these funding discrepancies, this law only allocates under a sixteenth of the lower estimate believed to be necessary to update infrastructure for all water systems in the U.S.</p>
<p>Weisman believes that raising awareness about the importance of water could be the key to solving this issue.</p>
<p>Many people are unwilling to pay for these improvements to infrastructure because it does not seem like a significant enough issue. Public opinion on this influences government spending, and the sooner people recognize the importance of this infrastructure, the sooner disadvantaged communities will have safe drinking water.</p>
<p>That is one of the biggest challenges the drinking water industry is facing, according to Weisman. Getting people to care about the issue of drinking water, particularly among communities who have not experienced a water crisis, is difficult.</p>
<p>“For most people, it’s out of sight, out of mind, and they don’t realize how important drinking water is until there’s a problem with it.”</p>
