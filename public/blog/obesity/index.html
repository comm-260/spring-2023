      <strong>By Zihan Zhang</strong>
      
        
      
    </h5>
    

    

    <p>When 21-year-old Chinese international student Shangman Zhao came to the United States to study, she found it difficult to strike a balance between her academic pursuits and maintaining a healthy diet. As a result, she started consuming more fast food, which led to weight gain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I see the number on the scale, I really feel distressed,&rdquo;&quot; Zhao said.</p>
<p>Zhao&rsquo;s experience is not uncommon, as global obesity rates have nearly doubled since 1975, with over 1 billion people worldwide classified as obese, including 650 million adults, 340 million adolescents, and 39 million children, according to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/04-03-2022-world-obesity-day-2022-accelerating-action-to-stop-obesity#:~:text=More%20than%201%20billion%20people,they%20are%20overweight%20or%20obese." target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Health Organization (WHO)</a>
. This number continues to rise, with an estimated 167 million people (including adults and children) projected to be less healthy due to overweight or obesity by 2025.</p>
<p>Fast food consumption has long been associated with obesity, as these meals often contain high calories, unhealthy fats, and added sugars. Research has shown that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4772793/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frequent consumption of fast food increases the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers, making it a significant public health concern.</a>
.</p>
<p>Moreover, while fast food has been linked to various health risks, it has also become an integral part of American culture and lifestyle. Fast food chains such as McDonald&rsquo;s, Burger King, and KFC have become iconic symbols of American cuisine, with their signature offerings widely recognized and consumed by millions of Americans.</p>
<p>Dr. Warren Nesbitt, the professor at American University, also a Nutrition Expert  said: &ldquo;Fast food chains have become the defect nutrition guides for millions of Americans, shaping their eating habits and preferences.&rdquo;&quot;</p>
<p>Fast food restaurants are often seen as a convenient solution for busy Americans seeking quick and convenient meals on the go, or for families looking for affordable dining options. The fast-paced lifestyle, longer working hours, and increasing reliance on convenience foods have contributed to the widespread popularity of fast food in the United States, making it an important part of American dietary culture.</p>
<p>According to data from the <a href="https://www.qsrmagazine.com/content/ranking-top-50-fast-food-chains-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quick-Service and Fast Casual Restaurant Magazine (QSR)</a>
, the top 50 fast food chains in the United States had a total system-wide sales revenue of an astonishing $250 billion in 2021.This impressive figure reflects the massive scale of the fast-food industry and its economic impact on the U.S. market. Millions of Americans visit fast food restaurants every day, and the industry has become a significant driver of income and employment, contributing to overall economic growth. However, it also highlights the enormous demand for fast food among consumers and its significant role in the U.S. restaurant industry. As fast food continues to be an important part of American dietary culture, its impact on the economy and society remains a topic of debate and discussion.</p>
<iframe title="The Top 15 fast food Brands by Sales in 2021" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-FJ0iW" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/FJ0iW/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="454" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>
<p>Fast food has become ubiquitous in many countries, providing quick, convenient, and often inexpensive meals. However, the increasing consumption of fast food has been associated with numerous health risks, particularly the rise in obesity rates. Research from the World Health Organization shows that fast food consumption is linked to higher body mass index (BMI), less successful weight loss maintenance, and weight gain, resulting in overall poor diet quality and increased obesity risk, especially in children and adolescents. Fast food typically contains high calories, saturated fat, sodium, and added sugars, while being low in essential nutrients such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. These unhealthy food choices can lead to weight gain.</p>
<p>To better understand the popularity of fast food and its impact on public health, some studies were conducted using data on the per capita number of fast-food restaurants in various states in the United States. The map shows that economically developed regions such as New York and California have a higher density of fast-food restaurants. The southern states of the United States have the highest per capita density of fast-food restaurants, with Alabama ranking at the top as the state with the highest proportion of fast-food restaurants to population. This suggests that there may be regional differences in fast food consumption patterns, and certain areas may be more susceptible to health risks associated with fast food consumption.</p>
<iframe title="Changes in obesity rates in the United States by state from 2020 to 2021" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-dNG0B" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dNG0B/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="512" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>
<p>There is a correlation between the high prevalence of fast-food restaurants in certain states, such as Alabama, and the increase in obesity rates in these areas. States with a higher concentration of fast-food restaurants often have higher obesity rates, as these establishments typically offer high-calorie, high-fat, and high-sugar foods that can lead to weight gain and obesity.</p>
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/13645096"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
<p>Fast food consumption has been identified as a significant factor contributing to the obesity epidemic. Fast food typically contains high calories, unhealthy fats, sodium, and added sugars, with low levels of essential nutrients, making it a poor dietary choice. A typical fast-food meal, such as a burger, fries, and a soft drink, can range from 1,500 to 2,000 calories, constituting a significant portion of the recommended daily caloric intake for adults.</p>
<p>Kun Chen, registered dietitian from Chinese Nutrition Society said: &quot;  Fast food is often high in calories, saturated fat, sodium and added sugars, and low in essential nutrients like fruits, vegetables and whole grains. These unhealthy food choices can lead to weight gain.&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Taking McDonald&rsquo;s as an example, a Big Mac, which can be considered a main dish, contains approximately 540 calories. If you add a medium-sized French fries, that would be an additional 380 calories. Of course, you might also want a small packet of ketchup, which has 15 calories. And perhaps you would like a refreshing medium-sized Coca-Cola, which contains 190 calories. This seemingly ordinary McDonald&rsquo;s lunch would then result in an intake of 1,125 calories in just one meal. Which is 75% of a human total daily calorie intake.</p>
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13645429"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the issue of fast-food consumption and obesity, as lockdowns and social distancing measures have limited people&rsquo;s access to healthier food choices and opportunities for physical exercise. With restaurants and dining establishments closing or operating with restrictions, more and more people have turned to delivery services, including fast food options.</p>
<p>The combination of increased fast-food consumption and reduced physical activity during periods of lockdown has raised concerns about weight gain and obesity. Research indicates that prolonged periods of staying at home can lead to boredom eating or emotional eating, further exacerbating the consumption of fast food and unhealthy food choices. Additionally, with limited opportunities to go to the gym or engage in outdoor activities, physical activity levels have decreased, resulting in a sedentary lifestyle that can contribute to weight gain and other health issues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During these challenging times, prioritizing a healthy diet is crucial for maintaining optimal health. Incorporating nutrient-dense foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats, can support a strong immune system and overall well-being.&rdquo;&quot; Dr. Nesbitt offered some advice on how people should keep themselves healthy during a pandemic by making dietary choices. &ldquo;Avoiding excessive consumption of sugary and processed foods, staying hydrated, and practicing mindful eating can also play a vital role in promoting good nutrition and mental well-being while navigating the pandemic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In conclusion, fast food consumption has become a significant part of American dietary culture, with both positive and negative impacts on the economy, society, and public health. While fast food offers convenience and affordability, it is also associated with various health risks, particularly obesity. Efforts to promote healthy eating habits and reduce fast food consumption are ongoing, including policy interventions, public health campaigns, and demand for healthier fast-food options. Making informed choices and adopting healthier eating habits can help mitigate the negative impact of fast food on public health.</p>
