    <p>“I was in a hole,” said 20-year-old Emma Boothroyd in reflecting on their mental health throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The college student is not alone in their suffering, as young adults remain among the most affected by mental illnesses in the United States.</p>
<p>In looking at clients under 30-years-old, individuals ages 18 to 20 were reported as the highest age group diagnosed with both depression and anxiety. This trend has remained consistent throughout the past six years as more individuals seek professional assistance for mental health related ailments.</p>

<p>In cases of depression and anxiety in all individuals under 30 years old in the United States from 2017 to 2020, individuals ages 18 to 20 report higher rates of depression than their young adult peers. A similar trend is seen in individuals in this age range reporting an anxiety disorder, with the exception of 2017 where individuals ages 25 to 29 were seen reporting the highest rates.</p>
<p>With a global event as widespread as the Coronavirus, measurable mental health implications remained as a result of pandemic related stressors. According to the National Institutes of Health, <a href="https://covid19.nih.gov/covid-19-topics/mental-health#:~:text=In%20a%202021%20study%2C%20nearly,the%20beginning%20of%20the%20pandemic." target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly half of U.S. citizens reported symptoms of anxiety or depression</a>
 in the year of 2021. However, three years removed from the beginning of the pandemic, the rates of mental health issues in the United States are beginning to slow.</p>
<iframe src='https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/13556241/embed' title='Interactive or visual content' class='flourish-embed-iframe' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' style='width:100%;height:600px;' sandbox='allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation'></iframe><div style='width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;'><a class='flourish-credit' href='https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/13556241/?utm_source=embed&utm_campaign=visualisation/13556241' target='_top' style='text-decoration:none!important'><img alt='Made with Flourish' src='https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg' style='width:105px!important;height:16px!important;border:none!important;margin:0!important;'> </a></div>
<p>Nationally the rates of mental illness in the country are progressively getting better gradually post pandemic, but certain states are lagging behind in recovery. As seen in the figure above, states like California and Texas remain among the most affected by mental illness in terms of the average indicator scores of depression and anxiety. These two states <a href="https://dailycampus.com/2023/01/17/study-conducted-on-which-states-have-the-most-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">house the most college students in the country</a>
, with 7 and 6% of their population being within this demographic.</p>
<p>With over 2.5 million students living in the state, California ranked 6th (2020), 11th (2021), 14th (2022) and 28th (2023) in the United States in terms of the average intensity of mental illness indicators. With an improved rate in 2023, California and its students are moving in the proper direction, while Texas neglects progress. In 2021, the state jumped from 7th most afflicted to 13th. However, in the two years that followed the state regressed to 9th (2022) and 8th (2023) heaviest impacted by the mental health crisis.</p>
<p>As this as student mental health began to gain traction during the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health professionals and researchers aimed to reach out to students to hear their perspectives on the crisis. Researchers like <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Pandya%20A%5BAuthor%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apruvakumar Pandaya</a>
 and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Lodha%20P%5BAuthor%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pragya Lodha</a>
 reported on the consequences of online schooling and social distancing. Included in their research was the fact that students in the U.S. are not alone in facing a further impact on mental illness throughout the pandemic.</p>
<p>“YoungMinds administered a worldwide student survey that reported 83% of young respondents agreed that the pandemic worsened pre-existing mental health conditions, mainly due to the closure of academic institutions, loss of routine, and restricted social connections,” wrote Pandya and Lodha.</p>
<p>Students across America have been among the demographics experiencing the most mental anguish for some time now, with the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbating these circumstances. And while general trends of mental health are beginning to improve, this group of individuals are still showing the highest signs of suffering.</p>
<p>“It’s trauma!” Boothroyd exclaimed. “It’s a traumatic communal experience that we all went through, and it doesn’t just disappear. It manifests itself into so many parts of my life for sure.”</p>
<p>Although the rate at which young adults are reporting mental illness has gone down since 2020, individuals ages 18 to 29 are experiencing higher rates of both depression and anxiety throughout the years that have followed the pandemic. In the three months of recorded data in 2023 alone, this demographic accounted for nearly a quarter of all anxiety and depression related disorders reported.</p>

<p>There is a lot of factors that contribute to poor mental health at this age, but the pandemic did not make it any easier. Students like Boothroyd, a rising junior at Emmerson College, had to navigate their freshman year of college through physical isolation. At a time riddled with uncertainty, socialization remains crucial and the impacts of the lack of community can affect an individual already suffering a large deal.</p>
<p>“It put a huge damper on my freshman year, I was in a massive depressive spiral for a while,” Boothroyd explained. “And obviously that wasn’t just because of covid, but the circumstances didn’t help. The feeling of community that I missed out on was a big factor in all of that.”</p>
<p>Current college freshmen did not have to navigate creating their home away from home in the midst of social distancing. However, the time uncertainty in their life that was once defined by the virus returns in the form of new experiences and environments. Students like freshman Jack Mullin, at the University of Loyola Marymount, were reminded of the fear they felt during times of physical isolation.</p>
<p>Mullin was born and raised in Boston, MA, and was ready to experience something new when he decided to pack his life up and move across the country for college. Although he could socialize without a physical restriction and attend classes in person, he was still facing a great deal of upheaval.</p>
<p>After learning the importance of support systems throughout the pandemic, Mullin said the prospect of building that community from the ground up caused him a great deal of anxiety.</p>
<p>“You quickly realize that a three-hour time change means that once its nighttime you basically can’t talk to anyone from home,” Mullin stated. “That made it more of a priority to establish something here, and I felt that it made it stronger too.”</p>
<p>Within his first week on the West Coast, Mullin realized how important using the resources available to him was. From friends to counselors to professors, he emphasized how important being able to reach out for help was in sustaining his mental wellbeing.</p>
<p>This is a sentiment colleges and universities across the U.S. have been pushing in recent years as troubling mental health trends continue. Many schools offer courses designed to ease incoming freshman into navigating the resources directly under their fingertips, counseling centers included.</p>
<p>Regardless of the resources made available to them, there is a hesitancy reach out to their university run counseling center. An education professor at Curry College, Dr. Joanne Seltzer, notes that not only are students more willing to come to her as a professor rather than an advisor in times of need, they also aren&rsquo;t reaching out as frequently as they should.</p>
<p>“It’s often times me poking into their lives to uncover what they are struggling with,” Seltzer explains. “Rather than them coming forward and saying, ‘This is what is impacting my academics.’”</p>
<p>However, it is not the apparent distrust of counseling centers that worries. Dr. Seltzer. It is the mental and academic impacts of the hesitation. The longer a student remains suffering in silence, the harder it is to pull themselves back out of that hole.</p>
<p>“They almost stay in that time of incapacity for a very long time before they are able or willing to reach out,” Seltzer said.</p>
<p>As college aged students remain the most depressed and anxious out of all young adults, the importance of establishing resources that students feel comfortable accessing is essential. Seltzer maintains an open-door policy throughout her students’ time at the college, encouraging them to come to her whenever they may need support.</p>
<p>However, support looks different for individuals in crisis. Whether it be a shoulder to cry on, a second chance or deeper psychological assistance, universities are working to match the needs of their students on all levels.</p>
<p>In the case of Boothroyd, they simply needed an opportunity to redeem themselves academically after a depressive episode set them back. Not only did their professor meeting this need help them academically, but the lengths their professor went to accommodate them made a lasting impact on their mental health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of my professors this semester gave me some extra assignments to do so I could make up for the classes I had missed,” explained Boothroyd. “And it just felt so wonderful and like he actually gave a shit. So, little things like that are really lovely.”</p>
<p>In addition to changing the ways mental health is delt with on a personal basis, steps need to be taken at a systemic level in order to fully combat this issue, as pointed out by Pandya and Lodha. In order to lessen the brevity of mental illness the concept of stigma needs to be addressed. Global mental health crises will not be aided until cultural shifts occur that reframe the way these disabilities are thought about and addressed.</p>
<p>“At the same time, creating a conducive environment to address the stigma around mental health and invigorate their students to seek help and support during such public health emergency is crucial,” they wrote. “Early interventions may result in improved long-term positive mental health outcomes for college students.”</p>
<p>While other demographics of individuals are healing from the wounds opened by the COVID-19 pandemic, young adults are continuing to suffer in silence. This nearly decade long trend may be concerning, but with proper accommodations and resources the lasting impacts may not be as devastating.</p>
